CPP-Pass
========

Hello, and welcome to the world's first totally impermeable password manager. We go to great lengths to make sure your data is never seen or heard from again.

Installation
------------

No matter how awesome this code is, all code is useless without being turned into the useless garbage that is machine code. Clearly being filed in a circular filing cabinet is not what we want. Here's how to avoid that dark fate.

From the project root, run these commands on a Linux or OS X terminal.

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make all

Testing
-------

And here we are required to point out the necessity of testing one's code. Lucky for you, we make it super easy.

    ctest

That wasn't so bad, was it?

How to Contribute
-----------------

Consider the following file structure

* `src` contains all _.cpp_ files
* `src/include` contains all _.h_ and _.hpp_ files
* `test` contains all unit tests

And now for a celebratory picture:

Wow. So zen.

Be sure to commit often while working on specific objectives.

I use CLion from IntelliJ. It's free for students and super clean. But I won't judge too harshly if you decide another IDE is superior.

Under no circumstances should you ever f_îU¡«êI♥{E↑e⌂6-èU⌂.xhO>ìoR1UIhelpimtrappedinarandomessfactoryOIS↔¢KµIå[L¢Ö2óä? \*noise\*

Now that we have all that cleared up, we hope you enjoyed your flight with RandomAndy Readme Tools, and have a nice day!
